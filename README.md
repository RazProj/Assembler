### Overview

This project implements an assembler in C, which translates assembly language code into machine code for a 12-bit processor. 
The assembler processes the input assembly files, checks for errors, and generates the corresponding machine code.

### Project Structure

* Assembler.c: The main file that orchestrates the overall assembly process by calling various functions from other modules.
* pre_assembler.c: Manages the pre-assembly process, including macros and file preprocessing.
* syntax_pass.c: Conducts syntax analysis of the assembly code to ensure correctness.
* error_checker.c: Contains functions to check for errors in the input assembly code.
* second_pass.c: Performs the second pass of the assembler, finalizing the machine code generation.
* creat_files.c: Handles the creation and management of output files generated by the assembler.
* general.c: Includes general utility functions used throughout the assembler.
* set_code.c: Handles the conversion of assembly instructions into machine code.
* set_tree.c: Manages the data structures and tree operations used during the assembly process.
* tree.c: Implements tree structures for storing and managing labels and symbols during assembly.
* Makefile: A makefile to automate the build process, compiling all necessary files and creating the final executable.

### How to Run the Program

* Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).
* Open the command line and navigate to the directory containing the source files.
* Build the program using the provided Makefile by writing `make`.This command will compile the source files and create the assembler executable.
* Run the program using the following command: `./assembler input_file`, where `input_file` is the name of the assembly file, and it should have the suffix `.as`.
